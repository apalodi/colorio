# Editor icons

We are using a bunch of custom made icon to make everything look better and have a better UX.
These icons are designed to be used inside Block Editor and in different places.

## Components Icons

Icons are used in the sidebar by the native core components. Generally, they are used in combination with the component label.

## Illustration Icons

Icons used in the modal helper component to provide a better understanding of what each custom functionality does like wrapper, columns, etc.

## BlockIcons

Icons are used as a block icon to provide a visual reference for the editors.
